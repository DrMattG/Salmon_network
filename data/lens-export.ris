AB  - The most documented fibrates are gemfibrozil, clofibrate and bezafibrate, while for statins, the majority of the published literature focuses on atorvastatin and simvastatin. The present work reviews previously published research concerning the effects of these hypocholesterolaemic pharmaceuticals on fish, with a particular focus on commercially important species, commonly produced by the European aquaculture industry, specifically in recirculated aquaculture systems (RAS). Overall, results suggest that both acute and chronic exposures to lipid-lowering compounds may have adverse effects on fish, disrupting their capacity to excrete exogenous substances, as well as both lipid metabolism and homeostasis, causing severe ontogenetic and endocrinological abnormalities, leading to hampered reproductive success (e.g., gametogenesis, fecundity), and skeletal or muscular malformations, having serious repercussions on fish health and welfare. Nonetheless, the available literature focusing on the effects of statins or fibrates on commonly farmed fish is still limited, and further research is required to understand the implications of this matter on aquaculture production, global food security and, ultimately, human health.

AB  - The salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) causes problems in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture in the Northern Hemisphere, because infestations can result in both a loss of production and in fish mortality. Several types of treatment have been used to control louse infestations, but these have seen varying success. The aim of this review is to examine the efficacy and safety of commonly used treatments (chemical, biological, mechanical, and preventive measures) as documented in peer-reviewed publications. Efficacy is assessed in relation to a reduction in numbers of lice, and safety is assessed as a lack of negative treatment-associated effects on fish health and welfare (Atlantic salmon and/or cleaner fish). Most chemical treatments showed decreasing efficacy over time, together with the use of increasing concentrations as a result of the development of resistance to the treatments by lice. The need for a restrictive use of pesticides to preserve treatment efficacy has been emphasized. The use of cleaner fish was suggested to be effective, with few or no negative effects towards Atlantic salmon. The use of cleaner fish would be preferable to chemical treatment if the farmed fish health and welfare criteria are met. At present, the number of peer-reviewed publications relating to other forms of treatment and prevention are sparse.

AB  - Thousands of Scottish wild fish were screened for pathogens by Marine Scotland Science. A systematic review of published and unpublished data on six key pathogens (Renibacterium salmoninarum, Aeromonas salmonicida, IPNV, ISAV, SAV and VHSV) found in Scottish wild and farmed fish was undertaken. Despite many reported cases in farmed fish, there was a limited number of positive samples from Scottish wild fish, however, there was evidence for interactions between wild and farmed fish. A slightly elevated IPNV prevalence was reported in wild marine fish caught close to Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., farms that had undergone clinical IPN. Salmonid alphavirus was isolated from wild marine fish caught near Atlantic salmon farms with a SAV infection history. Isolations of VHSV were made from cleaner wrasse (Labridae) used on Scottish Atlantic salmon farms and VHSV was detected in local wild marine fish. However, these pathogens have been detected in wild marine fish caught remotely from aquaculture sites. These data suggest that despite the large number of samples taken, there is limited evidence for clinical disease in wild fish due to these pathogens (although BKD and furunculosis historically occurred) and they are likely to have had a minimal impact on Scottish wild fish.

AB  - Salmon farming increases the abundance of salmon lice, which are ectoparasites of salmonids in the sea. Here we review the current knowledge on the effects of salmon lice on wild sea trout. Salmon lice feed on host mucus, skin and muscle, and infestation may induce osmoreg- ulatory dysfunction, physiological stress, anaemia, reduced feeding and growth, increased sus- ceptibility to secondary infections, reduced disease resistance and ultimately mortality of individ- ual sea trout. Wild sea trout in farm-free areas generally show low lice levels. In farm-intensive areas, lice levels on wild sea trout are typically higher, and more variable than in farm-free areas. Lice on wild sea trout are found at elevated levels particularly within 30 km of the nearest farms but can also extend to further ranges. Salmon lice in intensively farmed areas have negatively impacted wild sea trout populations by reducing growth and increasing marine mortality. Quan- tification of these impacts remains a challenge, although population-level effects have been quan- tified in Atlantic salmon by comparing the survival of chemically protected fish with control groups, which are relevant also for sea trout. Mortality attributable to salmon lice can lead to an average of 12�29% fewer salmon spawners. Reduced growth and increased mortality will reduce the benefits of marine migration for sea trout, and may also result in selection against anadromy in areas with high lice levels. Salmon lice-induced effects on sea trout populations may also extend to altered genetic composition and reduced diversity, and possibly to the local loss of sea trout, and establishment of exclusively freshwater resident populations.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In 2017, a new regulatory management system, the traffic light system (TLS), was implemented to estimate the effects of salmon lice from Norwegian salmon aquaculture on marine survival of wild Atlantic salmon and forms the basis of aquaculture capacity regulation. The TLS relies on observational data and a set of models to estimate the risk for negative impact on wild salmon populations. This review of the literature that forms the basis for the TLS as well as other relevant studies is presented in the context of the currently practiced TLS and suggestions are made for immediate and long‐term improvements. The main findings of this review are that: (1) assumed timing and duration of smolt migration contribute to unreliable observational and modelled data and overestimates of infection pressure; (2) production of lice larvae from farmed salmon is overestimated; (3) TLS model systems rely on or are calibrated by the same potentially flawed data; (4) lice‐associated mortality in wild salmon smolts may be overestimated; and (5) lice infection levels on farms are not associated with measurable effects on wild salmon. Recommendations to improve the accuracy and reliability of the TLS, and hence its environmental efficiency include the more complete use of available biological and physical environmental variables, adjusting the time period that observational data are registered and modelled data are integrated, adjusting the interpretation of data including recognition of uncertainty in model outcomes, and use of more realistic assumptions concerning lice‐induced mortality thresholds.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Sustainability of aquaculture, an important component of the blue economy, relies in part on ensuring assessment of environmental impact and interactions relating to sea lice dispersing from open pen salmon and trout farms. We review research underpinning the key stages in the sea lice infection process to support modelling of lice on wild salmon in relation to those on farms. The review is split into 5 stages: larval production; larval transport and survival; exposure and infestation of new hosts; development and survival of the attached stages; and impact on host populations. This modular structure allows the existing published data to be reviewed and assessed to identify data gaps in modelling sea lice impacts in a systematic way. Model parameterisation and parameter variation is discussed for each stage, providing an overview of knowledge strength and gaps. We conclude that a combination of literature review, empirical data collection and modelling studies are required on an iterative basis to ensure best practice is applied for sustainable aquaculture. The knowledge gained can then be optimised and applied at regional scales, with the most suitable modelling frameworks applied for the system, given regional limitations.</jats:p>

AB  - Parasites can, in theory, have large impacts on the survival of fish populations. One method to evaluate such impacts on anadromous species is to apply manipulative field experiments in which parallel groups of antiparasitically treated and non-treated fish are simultaneously released and then subsequently recaptured as returning adults. A systematic review and meta-analysis on all such Norwegian studies on Salmo salar provided a data set for the time period 1996 to 2011 on 118 release groups comprising 657 624 fish released and 3989 recaptured. The overall risk ratio (RR) was estimated to be 1.18 (95% CI: 1.07–1.30). The effect varied strongly between groups, (Higgins I2 = 40.1%). Over 70% of this heterogeneity could be explained by the release location, time period and baseline survival. The most important predictor variable was baseline survival. In groups with low recapture in the control group (low baseline survival), the effect of treatment was high (RR = 1.7), while in groups with high recapture in the control group (high baseline survival), there was no effect of treatment (RR ~ 1.00). The most prevalent parasite in the region affected by the drugs administered was Lepeophtheirus salmonis. Hence, the meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that L. salmonis contributes to the mortality of S. salar during outward migration. However, the effect of treatment was not consistent, but was evidently strongly modulated by other risk factors. The results suggest that the population-level effects of parasites cannot be estimated independently of other factors affecting the marine survival of S. salar.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The ecosystem approach to aquaculture (EAA) is a strategy for the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector, but the question of how it can be practically implemented remains unclear. Indicators that can be applied at relevant scales of impact and that reflect the environmental status and change offer a means of operationalizing EAA. Therefore, a systematic literature review was carried out to identify environmental indicators referenced in salmon aquaculture literature and review their potential to support EAA. Using the PRISMA method for selecting journal papers, 101 articles that included 531 indicators were reviewed. Indicators were characterized based on the effect of aquaculture they measure, their similarity to other indicators extracted, and the scale at which they were applied. Indicators and their characteristics are presented in a searchable online database. A scoring method for evaluating indicators based on criteria drawn from environmental indicator literature and the potential scalability of indicators to meet the needs of EAA was developed and applied to the most frequently referenced indicators. Overall, near‐field indicators of benthic impacts dominated salmon aquaculture literature. Of the most frequently referenced indicators, those that scored highest based on criteria drawn from environmental indicator literature also scored highest on scalability and therefore their potential contribution to EAA. Overall, results suggest that additional research and application of far‐field environmental indicators in salmon aquaculture will be required to identify a suite of indicators that can be applied as part of EAA practice.</jats:p>

AB  - Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector worldwide, mostly driven by a steadily increasing protein demand. In response to growing ecological concerns, life cycle assessment (LCA) emerged as a key environmental tool to measure the impacts of various production systems, including aquaculture. In this review, we focused on farmed salmonids to perform an in-depth analysis, investigating methodologies and comparing results of LCA studies of this finfish family in relation to species and production technologies. Identifying the environmental strengths and weaknesses of salmonid production technologies is central to ensure that industrial actors and policymakers make informed choices to take the production of this important marine livestock to a more sustainable path. Three critical aspects of salmonid LCAs were studied based on 24 articles and reports: (1) Methodological application, (2) construction of inventories, and (3) comparison of production technologies across studies. Our first assessment provides an overview and compares important methodological choices. The second analysis maps the main foreground and background data sources, as well as the state of process inclusion and exclusion. In the third section, a first attempt to compare life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) data across production technologies was conducted using a single factor statistical protocol. Overall, findings suggested a lack of methodological completeness and reporting in the literature and demonstrated that inventories suffered from incomplete description and partial disclosure. Our attempt to compare LCA results across studies was challenging due to confounding factors and poor data availability, but useful as a first step in highlighting the importance of production technology for salmonids. In groups where the data was robust enough for statistical comparison, both differences and mean equalities were identified, allowing ranking of technology clusters based on their average scores. We statistically demonstrated that sea-based systems outperform land-based technology in terms of energy demand and that sea-based systems have a generally higher FCR than land-based ones. Cross-study analytics also strongly suggest that open systems generate on average more eutrophying emissions than closed designs. We further discuss how to overcome bottlenecks currently hampering such LCA meta-analysis. Arguments are made in favor of further developing cross-study LCA analysis, particularly by increasing the number of salmonid LCA available (to improve sample sizes) and by reforming in-depth LCA practices to enable full reproducibility and greater access to inventory data.

AB  - Abstract Increased reliance on seafood has brought to light concerns regarding food safety, but the information to inform risk assessment or surveillance needs is lacking. A scoping study (ScS) was conducted to characterize published research investigating selected zoonotic bacteria and public health topics in various wild and farmed aquatic species and seafood. This was followed by a systematic review (SR) on selected bacteria (Aeromonas spp., generic Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Vibrio spp.) and aquatic species (clams, mussels, oysters, salmon, and shrimp [including prawn]); a meta-analysis (MA) was conducted only at the retail level due to considerable variability among various pathogen/seafood combinations. The ScS revealed the most frequently investigated themes were farm-level prevalence and intervention research for Vibrio spp. and Aeromonas spp. Antimicrobial use (AMU) and the association between AMU and antimicrobial resistance were rarely investigated. The SR indicated a consistent lac...

AB  - Knowledge of the prevalence of escaped farmed fishes in the wild is an essential first step to assessing the risk resulting from interactions between farmed and wild fishes. This is especially important in eastern North America, where Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture occurs near wild Atlantic salmon rivers and where many wild salmon popula- tions are severely depressed. Here, we review the literature on the incidence of escaped farmed salmon in eastern North American rivers, for which there has been no comprehensive compilation to date. Escaped farmed salmon have been found in 54 of 62 (87%) rivers investigated within a 300 km radius of the aquaculture industry since 1984, including 11 rivers that contain endangered salmon populations. Averaged among all investigations, the proportional representation of farmed salmon among adults entering the rivers from the sea was 9.2% (range 0% to 100%). Where data were sufficient to exam- ine temporal trends, farmed salmon proportions varied considerably over time, suggesting that escape events are episodic in nature. We conclude that escaped farmed salmon are sufficiently prevalent in eastern North American rivers to pose a potentially serious risk to the persistence of wild salmon populations, especially in those rivers that are adjacent to existing aquaculture sites.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Probiotics are microbial cells with multifunctional properties including immunostimulatory function in their host. Today, probiotics are widely used for controlling diseases in aquaculture, especially for rainbow trout, <jats:italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</jats:italic>, as the most important commercial cold‐water fish in the world. So far, many studies have been conducted on the effect of probiotics on the immune system of rainbow trout, but due to different experimental conditions, these results are different and sometimes inconsistent. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review and meta‐analysis to eliminate inconsistencies and to clarify the results related to some immune parameters in rainbow trout. This study is the first meta‐analysis study of probiotic‐induced effects on the immune system of rainbow trout. In order to perform meta‐analysis, four Internet databases, PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar were systematically searched until 27/03/2020 and after receiving related articles, effect sizes related to 10 outcomes including serum and plasma lysozyme activity, ACH50 activity, Ig activity, serum complement activity, phagocytosis activity, serum total protein activity and respiratory burst activity were evaluated by SMD and Hedges' <jats:italic>g</jats:italic> statistic and 95% CI was calculated from a random effects model. The SYRCL’S risk of bias tool for animal study was also used to assess the quality of the studies. Meta‐analysis was performed for 36 studies by 499 experiments. The effect of probiotics on immunity components was as follows: serum lysozyme activity (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05), plasma lysozyme activity (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &gt; 0.05), Serum ACH50 activity (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05), Plasma ACH50 activity (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05), serum immunoglobulin activity (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05), plasma immunoglobulin activity (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05), total serum protein activity (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05), serum complement activity (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05), phagocytic activity (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) and respiratory burst activity (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that, except plasma lysozyme activity and burst activity, probiotics could enhance immune system of rainbow trout.</jats:p>

AB  - The objective of Aquarius project was to test the applicability of a food chain analysis on Atlantic salmon farmed in Norway to identify and monitor vulnerabilities and drivers of change for the identification of emerging risks. To this end, a comprehensive literature review was conducted complemented with expert views collected by on-line questionnaires and in-depth interviews. This review provided an overview of the various stages in the supply chain from farm to consumer and the identification of i) existing and emerging human and animal health hazards, ii) vulnerabilities, iii) control measures, iv) drivers of change, and v) related indicators. Next step in the study was to i) complement the list of vulnerabilities followed by a prioritisation using focus group discussions and Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) method and ii) link drivers of change acting upon the (prioritised) vulnerabilities and identification of associated indicators and data sources by means of a Delphi method. Based on the experiences obtained with the different methodologies during this project, the Aquarius team considers literature review, and a direct face-to-face interaction with experts (in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and FMEA in a workshop setting) as being most effective regarding output and effort. The comprehensive information collected formed the basis for the methodology to baseline key indicators of the selected vulnerabilities. The methodology proposed comprised a Bayesian Network (BN) that links data sources for indicators and drivers of change to the prioritised vulnerabilities and was demonstrated for salmon health. A Decision Support System (DSS) with such BN integrated was designed. The current BN and DSS could flag an increased exposure of known hazards that may occur due to changes in indicators but new hazards are not identified. The proposed methodology could be used instead to show trends in vulnerabilities, indicators, increased exposure of known hazards and for scenario studies.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>One of the major bottlenecks affecting the expansion of the freshwater aquaculture sector in developing countries is the outbreak of diseases. Fish farmers have traditionally relied on antibiotics and synthetic chemicals to control diseases. However, antibiotics and synthetic chemicals are associated with negative effects on the environment and consumers and their excessive use has resulted in antibiotic-resistant pathogens. In addition, the majority of freshwater fish farmers, especially small-scale farmers, have limited access to antibiotics and synthetic chemicals due to lack of resources. Medicinal plants have been reported to be suitable replacements in aquaculture, but their usage in aquaculture is still limited. The aim of this paper is to undertake a meta-analysis on the effect of medicinal plants on innate immune response and disease resistance in commonly farmed freshwater aquaculture fish species, namely Mozambique tilapia (<jats:italic>Oreochromis mossambicus</jats:italic>), African catfish (<jats:italic>Clarias gariepinus</jats:italic>), trout (<jats:italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</jats:italic>), and cyprinids (<jats:italic>Labeo rohita</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Cyprinus carpio</jats:italic>). The analysis showed that the mean effect size for respiratory burst (− 1.90 (95% CI − 2.40; − 1.40), <jats:italic>I</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 100%, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0); lysozyme activity (0.05 (95% CI − 0.38; 0.48), <jats:italic>I</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 97%, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01); white blood cells (− 0.69 (95% CI − 1.16; − 0.23), <jats:italic>I</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 89%, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01); and phagocytic activity (− 1.21 (95% CI − 2.08; − 0.35), <jats:italic>I</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 91%, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01) was significantly different. Mean effect size for survival rates was not significantly different (2.56 (95% CI 0.10; 5.01), <jats:italic>I</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0%, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 1). The funnel plots for all parameters were asymmetrical, which indicates possible publication bias or the presence of systematic differences or inconsistencies among studies. Overall, the meta-analysis showed that medicinal plants could enhance immunity and disease resistance in tilapia, African catfish, carp, and trout. These findings reinforce the observation that plant supplements can be used to prevent disease outbreaks in aquaculture. It is therefore recommended that freshwater fish farmers in African regions such as Southern Africa learn to produce their own diets supplemented with plants at their farms in order to prevent diseases in cultured fish.

AB  - The Atlantic salmon aquaculture industry still struggles with ectoparasitic sea lice despite decades of research and development invested into louse removal methods. In contrast, methods to prevent infestations before they occur have received relatively little research effort, yet may offer key benefits over treatment‐focused methods. Here, we summarise the range of potential and existing preventative methods, conduct a meta‐analysis of studies trialling the efficacy of existing preventative methods and discuss the rationale for a shift to the prevention‐focused louse management paradigm. Barrier technologies that minimise host–parasite encounter rates provide the greatest protection against lice, with a weighted median 76% reduction in infestation density in cages with plankton mesh ‘snorkels’ or ‘skirts’, and up to a 100% reduction for fully enclosed cages. Other methods such as geographic spatiotemporal management, manipulation of swimming depth, functional feeds, repellents and host cue masking can drive smaller reductions that may be additive when used in combination with barrier technologies. Finally, ongoing development of louse‐resistant salmon lineages may lead to long‐term improvements if genetic gain is maintained, while the development of an effective vaccine remains a key target. Preventative methods emphasise host resistance traits while simultaneously reducing host–parasite encounters. Effective implementation has the potential to dramatically reduce the need for delousing and thus improve fish welfare, productivity and sustainability in louse‐prone salmon farming regions.

AB  - <jats:p>In this review, we have systematized current knowledge about the effect of stocking lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) as cleaner fish to control Lepeophtheirus salmonis infestations on farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). The review was prompted by recent reports in which the usefulness of lumpfish has been doubted, and the urgent need to investigate whether common lumpfish can be used to reduce L. salmonis numbers on farmed Atlantic salmon by active grazing on this species. Available published data clearly indicate that lumpfish graze on L. salmonis, and can significantly lower the lice burden in Atlantic salmon farming. It is possible to enhance the lice grazing behavior of lumpfish with the assistance of live feed conditioning prior to sea pen transfer, and with selective breeding. Data indicate that lice grazing of lumpfish is size dependent, and grazing effect is low for lumpfish larger than 200–250 g. Observations from large-scale rearing of Atlantic salmon in open sea cages in Norway, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and Scotland also indicate that lumpfish can be effective in lowering infestations of L. salmonis on salmon. Overall, this present review reveals that lumpfish can actively contribute to lower numbers of L. salmonis on farmed Atlantic salmon.</jats:p>

AB  - The European aquacultural sector is undergoing immense growth, and, generally, many more aquatic animals are farmed than land animals. However, the welfare of aquatic animals like fish has received less attention. This study focuses on the two largest contributors to Europe's aquaculture – Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout – farmed in cages in Northern Europe. An extensive literature review was conducted on potential welfare issues. These issues were grouped into five provisions / welfare aims according to an animal welfare framework adapted to fish. To set priorities among the issues, a Delphi assessment was performed, for which experts had to rate each issue based on the severity, duration, and prevalence. The participants were also asked to propose interventions to tackle the main issues. The three main welfare issues identified were ineffective prevention of diseases, sea lice treatment issues, and poor conditions during husbandry practices. Examples of interventions to improve the three main issues are lowering the stocking density, better monitoring, and specifically to prevent diseases, including sea lice, also developing more effective vaccines. This study provides valuable insights into which fish welfare issues should be tackled more urgently in European salmonid aquaculture. Future research could assess interventions more in depth and conduct similar studies for other aquatic farm animals and regions.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Fish aquaculture has become the fastest growing sector in global food production. Thus, ensuring the sustainability of aquaculture practices is of the utmost importance. Studies in higher vertebrates (i.e. mammals) have demonstrated the role of the host microbiome in physiological processes from nutrient acquisition to pathogen protection. Therefore, analysis of fish microbiomes is an important factor to consider with regard to overall animal health and welfare. Rainbow trout (<jats:italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</jats:italic>) are an economically valued fish cultured worldwide. Several studies have identified microbial constituents inhabiting the intestinal tract of rainbow trout. To better elucidate some of the core constituents of the rainbow trout intestinal microbiome, this systematic literature review analysed the relative abundance results from 25 articles published on the rainbow trout intestinal microbiome from 2017 to 2021. Bacteria classified within the phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were observed in every study. At the family level, <jats:italic>Lactobacillaceae</jats:italic> was consistently observed. Additionally, bacteria in the Actinobacteria, Bacteroides, and Tenericutes phyla were identified in at least 50% of the studies. Interestingly, <jats:italic>Mycoplasma</jats:italic> spp. were occasionally the most dominant organisms present in the microbiome. Overall, the results here identify bacteria that are commonly found members of the rainbow trout intestinal microbiome.</jats:p>

AB  - In this Opinion, the antimicrobial-resistant bacteria responsible for transmissible diseases that constitute a threat to the health of certain kept fish species have been assessed. Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>), carp (<i>Cyprinus</i> spp.), rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>), sea bream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) and tilapia (<i>Oreochromis</i> spp.), selected as representative of the most important fish species and production systems that are commercially reared in fresh and saltwater farms, were the focus of this assessment. The assessment was performed following a methodology based on information collected by an extensive literature review and expert judgement. Details of the methodology used for this assessment are explained in a separate Opinion. The global state of play of antimicrobial resistance in <i>Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas salmonicida, Flavobacterium psychrophilum</i> and <i>Flavobacterium columnare</i> is provided. Among these bacteria, none was identified as being among the most relevant antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in the assessed kept fish species in the EU due to the very limited scientific evidence available.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The price of fishmeal (FM) has been increasing continuously due to the expansion of the gap between its stable production and rising demand. Therefore, plant protein sources are widely applied in the aquaculture industry to accomplish the protein requirement of farmed fish species. However, the massive number of results produced under various experimental conditions appended challenges for comprehensive summarization and comparison of the effects of plant protein sources on carnivorous fish species. Thus, a systemic review and meta‐analysis were conducted to compare the impacts of various plant protein sources on growth, feed utilization efficiencies, blood lipid, and liver health of representative carnivorous species. Supported by the data from 256 articles, our results indicated that Atlantic salmon, African catfish, Black seabass, and Hybrid striped bass were better at utilizing plant protein sources than Grouper and Japanese seabass. Cottonseed and lupin proteins were promising protein alternatives, while rapeseed showed significant growth suppression effects for these carnivorous fish species. Besides, deep processing methods such as fermentation and enzymolysis alleviated undesirable consequences effectively when less than half of FM was replaced by plant protein sources. Moreover, the optimal plant protein sources are discussed for each fish species. Overall, this article depicts the impact patterns of major plant protein sources on carnivorous farmed fish species and lays a solid foundation for further investigation on mechanisms for improving plant protein utilization.</jats:p>
